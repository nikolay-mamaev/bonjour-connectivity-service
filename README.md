bonjour-connectivity-service
============================

A library to transfer data between iOS and Mac OS X devices using Bonjour. Includes browsing, connecting, sharing data. Currently only trasferring strings is implemented (to transfer binary data, please use Base64 encoding/decoding). Probably property lists & NSData transferring will be implemented later.
